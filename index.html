      <h5>INTRODUCTION</h5>
      <p>
        Since its inception in 2016, Resolve Philly has evolved as a proving ground that incubates innovative  journalistic projects. Resolve was developed to address how historically misrepresented communities, particularly those experiencing racial injustice and economic hardship, are covered by the media. We are an unconventional nonprofit challenging the field of journalism to be equitable, collaborative, and informed by community voices and solutions. In a time of widespread mistrust, political division, and industry upheaval, journalists must consider not just what they report, but how they find, frame, and tell stories. 
      </p>
      <div class="callout">
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Don't want to read all this? Check out our <a href="look.html">infographic</a>.</p>
      </div>
      <p>
        We seek to redefine reporting in ways that are more community-responsive, data-driven, and solutions-oriented rather than problem-focused. We charge the industry to rethink how it sources news and who reports it. But we also challenge the notion that community advocacy is wholly distinct from journalism and believe reporting can be focused as a force for positive change.
      </p>
      <p>
        Resolve Philly promotes the practice of solutions-based reporting that transforms how newsrooms and individual journalists conduct their work. We facilitate collaboration where there was once competition. We are building the newsroom of the future to reach far beyond an individual media outlet or medium and narrow the gap between reporter and “source.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The organization grew from an initiative by the Solutions Journalism Network to promote collaborative solutions-based reporting on prisoner reentry, a critical issue facing Philadelphia. Throughout 2017, The Reentry Project’s 13 newsroom partners reported and broadcast approximately 200 stories, bringing a topic previously on the margins to the front pages. In April 2018, Resolve launched Broke in Philly, a collaborative reporting project on solutions to poverty and economic mobility. As of December 2019, the collaborative includes 24 partner organizations. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We promote collaborative solutions-based reporting that not only intends to evolve how communities are covered but also how individual journalists view critical issues such as incarceration, economic mobility and inclusion, and racial justice. We intentionally embody the following values in everything we do, and practice the change we seek in the industry as we operate our own organization:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>Equity and Inclusion.</i>  Resolve actively works to remove barriers to equal access, treatment, and outcomes for historically misrepresented communities, particularly when it comes to news media coverage. We start every effort by listening to those community voices to inform our work. We have intentionally established a diverse and equitable team to ensure that commitment is deeply rooted in both a personal and professional understanding. 
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Collaboration.</i>  We seek efficiency through collaboration, focusing on identifying and filling unmet needs and gaps. We focus resources where we can be most effective, including helping to raise the profile of creative programs and initiatives that complement our work.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Accountability and Transparency.</i> We practice radical transparency. Anyone and everyone ought to be able to see how our values guide our work, and understand why we make decisions and how. We believe we should be accountable not only to our funders, but to all stakeholders for our efforts. We continually seek out  a diverse range of voices to inform and provide feedback on our work. Leading by example allows us to build trust with all of our stakeholders, especially with communities whose trust in the media and related institutions has been broken.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        As a small, collaborative, committed team, we strive to carry out our mission with integrity, equity, and joy. Our shared leadership structure represents another way of embodying this approach: decision-making by our co-executive directors is shared, just as multiple perspectives and voices are needed to ensure equity, diversity, and inclusion.

      <h5>OUR KEY PRIORITIES</h5>
      <p>
        Resolve Philly’s strategic plan consists of five key priorities: Collaborative Solutions Journalism, Sustainability, Practicing Allyship, Transforming How Communities Engage with News and Information, and Building a Community of Leaders. We have set three overarching goals for each priority, and have highlighted measures of success and current/future activities for each.

      <p>
        Twenty years ago, Philadelphia was known as one of the most competitive local media landscapes in the country and now we are known nationally for being one of the most, if not the most, collaborative. Additionally, Philadelphia has become a hotbed for solutions journalism - the practice of rigorous reporting on solutions to complex problems - with funders like Knight Foundation, Lenfest Institute for Journalism, Solutions Journalism Network, and Independence Public Media Foundation investing heavily in its practice in Philly’s local news ecosystem.

        Resolve plugs in where we are most helpful, focusing our resources where we can be most effective. We are proving through our Broke in Philly partners, those newsrooms executing our current collaborative reporting project which will last through April 2023, that when newsrooms collaborate around stories or coordinate coverage, it creates mutual benefit.
      </p>
      <p>
        We take our role as a pioneer in the local news collaboration space seriously. We are constantly challenging  boundaries to produce and sustain initiatives that result in better journalism, enhanced capacity within the Philadelphia news ecosystem, and real impact in our communities.

        Rather than reinvent the wheel, we dedicate  resources where we can be most effective, including helping to raise the profile of innovative programs and initiatives that complement our work. Effective collaboration also requires trust. Resolve Philly seeks to create a virtuous circle of trusted relationships between and among journalists and communities. We believe that when the news is told responsibly and serves and reaches  the people it covers, it inspires communities to trust journalists and journalism. In turn, they will be more likely to add their voice and perspective in the future.

      <h3 class="section-header" id="ally-head">PRACTICING ALLYSHIP</h3>
      <p>
        We define allyship as, “a lifelong process of building relationships based on trust, consistency and accountability.” We practice allyship by making intentional choices about how we partner with colleague organizations, how we spend our money, and the types of businesses with which we prioritize building relationships. We believe there is great power in allyship and community investment for personal, professional, and economic growth within historically misrepresented communities and we want our organization to be a positive force towards this end.

        In one example of this practice, we identified three different companies — all owned by business owners from underrepresented communities — to cater one of our 2019 events, opening up access to future opportunities and growth for these businesses. The event goal was to enable attendees to participate in conversations on economic growth and mobility where they are typically absent and to provide under-represented attendees with opportunities to engage with journalists. This event, which ten of our reporting partners participated in or covered in some way, drew more than 500 people and boasted record attendance from communities of color for the space where the event was held.

      <p>
        Another way we are practicing allyship is by developing resources based on the collaborative solutions journalism model that Broke in Philly partners have pioneered. With the model gaining increasing recognition and attracting interest from across the globe, we are often asked whether Resolve plans to launch and lead similar efforts in other places. While being at the helm replication is not a part of Resolve’s strategy, we do see a massive opportunity for us to plug in and leverage our learnings. Over the coming years, we will produce useful and accessible resources, including guidebooks, best practices, and frameworks for implementation that will be made available to  journalists around the world. We see this as a demonstration of allyship; it is not our place to parachute in and launch collaborative projects in communities that we don’t belong to.

      <p>
        Resolve Philly wants to revolutionize how local news is reported so that it is centered in community voices and solutions, and revolves around equitable and collaborative processes. We seek to better equip historically misrepresented communities with accessible data, news, and information that is useful, accurate, and representative. We aim to change how journalists view and value the perspectives of community members, promoting trust in community experiences and dismantling deficit models. By reframing community challenges around strengths, highlighting effective and proven solutions, and reporting on events with accuracy and dignity, local journalism has the potential to be a force for personal and community growth. This is the basis of our community engagement framework.

        Research demonstrates that successful community engagement outcomes hinge on building relationships of trust and accountability with community members through addressing issues of relevance, in a way that is accurate and representative, and following-through on proposed changes and ideas. These processes can be measured over time and that data can be used to continually evolve community engagement practices. Successful community-engaged reporting requires the collaborative effort of internal and external stakeholders and partners — reporters, editors, publishers, funders — working alongside and listening to members of the community to create reporting that can be “of value” to community members.

        Through monthly community meet-ups facilitated by Resolve’s Community Engagement Editor, the Community Standards Panel (one of the ‘analog’ components of the Reframe suite of tools being piloted in Summer 2020), the establishment of mechanisms that enable our reporting partners to efficiently and respectfully receive and respond to feedback and corrections from community members, and a host of other news, data, and storytelling engagement opportunities, we are committed to setting a new standard of community engagement with local news.

      <p>
        It’s no secret that investing in leadership development among the ranks of an organization can often be the ultimate differentiator between organizations that are agile, efficient, impactful, and lasting, and those that aren’t. Resolve Philly is taking this investment one step further with a deep commitment to our role in building a community of leaders -- within Resolve Philly, among our newsroom partners, and indeed, across our entire community. 
      </p>

    <div class="container-fluid infographic">

      <p>
        One of the ways in which we are carrying out this work is through skill development and the expansion of capacity in our newsroom partners. Resolve Philly identified a gap around data journalism in our local news community. Good data journalism requires resources that many of our newsroom partners just don’t have. Through modeling, training and professional development with the Broke in Philly partners, and the co-creation of data journalism pieces, Resolve Philly is building a community of leaders in data journalism among the members of the reporting collaborative. Not only will this investment lead to the development of individuals and expanded capacity in newsrooms, but with a critical mass of local news media engaging in better data journalism practices, we expect impact at the community level as well.

        <source src="podcast/Community of Leaders.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
      </audio>
      <p>
        Our vision of a community of leaders looks quite different from a more traditional leadership model, with transformation and decision-making driven from the top, down. Through internal professional development for our team, skill- and capacity-building among our newsroom partners, and meaningful (paid) internship and fellowship programs for members of our community who are interested in storytelling and the delivery of news and information, Resolve Philly works to build leaders that reach out from the core, not down from the top.

      <h5>CONCLUSION</h5>
      <p>
        Our projects create the tools and opportunities for journalists to execute their work differently. Over the next five years, Resolve Philly will invest in technology that empowers community connection, reporting collectives that generate collaborative coverage on community-driven solutions, and innovative networks for coordinating reporting on important topics. We invite you to join us.
